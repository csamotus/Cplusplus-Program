# Cplusplus-Program


# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving, and reflect upon your experience.

This project was developed to be able to read a file containing a list of items and then output various data points about the list. The data points available from the code are a list of unique items and their numerical count, the numerical count of a specified item based on the list, and a histogram depicting the numerical count per item.  The project used both C++ and Python code.  C++ was used to enhance the user interface and create the histogram, and Python was used to read the file and perform the data analysis.

I am quite proud of the final version of this project.  It was my first time successfully combining 2 sets of code that I wrote on my own, minus the connection functions provided by the module.  It helped me improve on my data validation in C++ as well.  One thing I'd like to work on for the future is to update the code to be able to prompt the user for the file name, rather than using the set project list I was provided.  That would allow this program to be used by anyone with a list of items and not just those with access to the code to know what to name the source file.  I am looking forward to me next classes and learning how to better intergrate multiple programming languages and when to know that it is appropriate/valuable to do so.
